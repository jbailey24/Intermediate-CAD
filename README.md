In this assignment, I made a spool, and changed the dimensions using design tables.

I had never used the design tables before, and so I found this assignment very interesting. To start out, I had some issues figuring out how the tables worked, but by the end, I understood them pretty well and had a lot of fun clicking through the configurations and seeing how they changed.

In this assignment, I learned how to use advanced and mechanical mates by making a little moving contraption.

The making of the individual parts was fairly easy. I used what I learned about design tables in the last assignment to make the configurations of the box. In the assembly, I used the width mate to line all of boxes up, a Linear/Linear Coupler to dictate how the small box moved, and a slot mate to place the pin. None of this was too difficult, but good to learn all the same. Also, this has to be mentioned, having an assembly which can move is highly entertaining.
